General Info:
TEL as the name suggests is a derivative of
the linux terminal environment app Termux. 
The main difference being that TEL is designed and configured as a launcher / homescreen replacement.
Use of TEL is not recommended for those without prior knowledge of the linux or termux environment.
more information can be found at the TEL github / Wiki page @ https://t-e-l.github.io

For further discussion, help and info join the TEL Telegram community page @ https://t.me/tui_expert/4649

Useful info:
add your own aliases into ~/.aliases
if you want to remove status pane, using ctrl + c with the status pane selected will close down pane and also notification listener. A better idea might be to customise your bar by moving scripts in or out of ~/.tel/status_scripts/active or editing the config file ~/.tel/config.sh


Useful shortcuts:
ctrl + f2 = new split pane
F2        = new window
F3	  = toggle active window
F6        = immediately quit all (no warning!) 

Useful commands:
x         = killall windows and exit tel
a         = app launcher
s         = search duckduckgo
todo      = to-do list manager
p         = app dialer
t         = app telegram

Trouble-shooting:
We encourage reporting of errors through github although support maybe quicker through telegram. 

Only use TEL plugins from the offical github, any termux plugins from elsewhere are likely to cause issues.
Make sure you have the TEL API addon downloaded from TEL git page.
The TEL API is slightly different from the Termux API although it will appear under "Termux API" in installed apps list.
If your experiencing issues you	can try changing settings in the ~/.tel/config folder. Issues may vary upon how your device vendor handles battery saving behavior, if you think this is causing issues you can temporarily disable power saving settings \ optimisation for TEL and API, in the android app settings. You are unlikely to need to grant TEL extra permissions but it is a good thing to check if experiencing issues. Don't forget to restart by exiting fully to see changes.

If you wish to start completely fresh (WARNING: will remove user files also) clear TEL app cache and storage via android settings, then uninstall TEL App and all TEL/Termux plugin apps. Make sure ALL Termux related apps and plugins are completely removed before redownloading the latest version of TEL app, opening and running tel-setup.
