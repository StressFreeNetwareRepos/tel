Here are my personal beta builds while T-UI 2 is in work.
I will merge usable features, but do not expect a stable release!

All addon updates get merged and build automatically.

### Build Status:

![build](https://api.travis-ci.com/t-e-l/tel.svg?branch=master)

### Bugs & Issues:
Feel free to add issues or pull requests, but keep in mind that the important things go first.
